Oh; what will you do, what will you do?\n\nWell if you're looking for a quick, simple and cheap solution you've come to the right place.\n\nMy daily phone is a MotoX and I have a Incipio 'Off the Grid' case for it. A nice case by the way; it has a backup battery built into it which you can use to recharge up the phone when it's running low. I recently acquired an older Galaxy S2 to use primarily as a media player, something I can use to keep some tunes on board for when I'm out mowing the back 40, some movies to watch while the wife unit is dragging me through the isles of a department store (or I'm witing in the car), things like that, as well as a GPS app that doesnt need cell service because I don't have the device hooked up to one; just wifi. I wanted something I could throw a 64gb SD card in for plenty of storage which I cant do on the Motox, this also allows me to use the X for what I need it for.\n\nIf they ever made a case for the S2 like I have for my daily phone I haven't found it. I was figuring I would have to keep a spare battery on hand to throw into the S2 when needed then I stumbled across this extended life battery. I may still get another of these batteries as a backup for when we go on vacation and I'm taking a gazillion photos with the phones camera.\n\nNot only do you get the battery but also a form-fitting replacement cover for the back of your phone which snaps on like it was always meant to be there. Now while out all day doing stuff I can listen to my phone/media player with my pair of Bluetooth headphones and still have oodles of power left over; to say that I am pleased would be a masterpiece of an understatement.\n\nYeah it does add some bulk to the phone so your old case more than likely won't fit; that really should be no surprise; you are putting in a battery that is twice as thick. I don't know about you but I am real hard on my toys (my first MotoX lasted 80 days before I shattered the screen) a tough case (and tempered glass screen protector) is a must.\n\nBefore I found & ordered this extended life battery I bought this case to protect the S2: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070HVR8U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00\n\nThis is a nice tough case; it is a two part unit with a thick rubber outer shell covering a sturdy plastic two piece inner case; just what a klutz like me needs. Iy has a little kick-stand sort of thing to supposedly allow you to prop up the phone but I never use it; in fact it came off in my hand the first time I pulled it out and I had a devil of a time putting it back; I could have just left it off.\n\nWhile waiting for this battery I started looking around for a case designed to fit the phone with the added bulk; there was one I found but it was not available anymore at the time of this writing; which isn't surprising considering the generation of this phone and they are up to I think the S6 now. So I looking it to ways I could make what is still available work.\n\nI then thought I could get one of those cheap thin silicone cases for it; maybe cut out the area where the bump from the thicker battery sits; the replacement cover you will get is pretty sturdy. This led me to wonder then if I could just cut out that area of the inner shell of the case I already had; there are raised areas of the shell which give it some thickness; the rubber shell is made larger to compensate, would it be able to handle a little more? I may still do that, but the solution I found was even simpler (I like simple).\n\nI did away all together with the back part of the inner case, I just used the top part, and wrapped the thick rubber outer shell over it like I normally would.\n\nNow, it does take a slender phone made bulky with this battery and make it even a little bit more so, and it doesn't fit super tight in the area where the camera is (which doesn't affect the camera or flash at all), honestly, if you're so OCD that the little bit that it sticks up really bothers you, you may have other issues a case won't help with ;-). Bottom line for me is that it fits snug and, more importantly protects my toy from its butter-fingered owners clumsiness.\n\nYou can check out the photos and decide for yourself it will work for you.\n\nHave a MAGICAL day!", "summary": "Excellent solution and YES: YOU CAN GET A CASE TO FIT IT.", "unixReviewTime": 1435708800}

My original battery was slowly dying, so I decided to buy this one and get more juice. Since day one, battery has a horribly short life. I charge my phone overnight, 100% charged, unplug it and go to work. I pull the phone off my purse and in 20 minutes it has dropped to 70%. 3 hrs later, without it being used at all (while at work, my phone stays in my locker) and it already is less than 30%.  My husband thought that maybe some app was running in the background, so went as far as taking ALL the apps off the phone. Same thing, battery doesn't last more than 6-8 hrs. It also makes my phone very hot.  Very disappointing product. Do not recommend it all. Now I am going to have to buy a regular battery and spend more money.\nUpdate on issue. 05/10/14\nSo, I contacted the seller and explained my problem and I got this response:\n\nHello,\n  I apologize for your dissatisfaction with our product. I can certainly ship\nyou a replacement package, free of charge, or issue you a refund, if you prefer.\nHowever, we do require the products getting returned to us, so we can test the\nitem for our manufacturer to see if it is a bigger issue than just this\nincident.  If you could please send the items back with a receipt of postage\ncosts (so we can compensate you if the item is deemed defective or incorrect),\nyour Amazon Order ID number, and the course of action you wish to be taken when\nwe receive your package (Reshipment/Refund).\nI purchased my battery on March 22nd and it was delivered on April 1st. Then, I wrote again letting them know I was sending the battery and I got this response:\n\nHello,\n  I apologize, we only offer a 30 day return policy. If you have been using the\nbattery we would not be able to accept the return.\n\nWhy offer a replacement/refund and then go back on your word like that? I have to use the battery to know if it works or not, common sense. They were aware of the time frames at all times.

Especially since plugging in my phone restored my phone and the battery indicated 75% or so full.  But indeed, the battery was dying.\n\nI purchased a OEM battery which restored my phone (so it was definitely a battery issue).  This battery arrived later and now I installed it.  It doubles the time you can browse on the phone if you must or utilizing the navigation - what a great improvement.  It comes also with a battery cover (battery is twice as thick), which does make the phone kind of nicer to handle as stated elsewhere in a different review.  Also, this cover does fit my Galaxy S2 perfectly without issues.  It's important that you have the SPH-710 as Samsung manufactured an array of slightly different versions.  The SPH-710 was one of the first released models (let's say I know because I work in the mobile chip industry as an engineer for a manufacturer starting with an S).\n\nTherefore, I give this battery/cover combination 5 stars as long as you understand that it is specifically for the SPH 710 version of the Galaxy SII.\n\nThe shipment was as promised, very well packaged, and the product is definitely of legitimate quality.

This phone is advertised as an \"Unlocked\" phone, but this is a lie.  Extra Virgin Tech did not truly unlock the phone but tried to subvert the network lock by installing a custom ROM (Operating System).  This is why the phone was having a problem working on the AT&T network, which is the network the phone was originally locked to.  After installing the stock ROM, the phone has worked fine on AT&T, but it could not be used on other networks and required a network unlock key to unlock the phone.  After talking with some Android phone experts, I was informed that flashing the phone with a custom rom (installing a new OS)does not truly unlock a phone because the network lock is part of the Firmware of the phone, not the Operating System software of the phone.  Once a phone is truly firmware unlocked, it will remain unlocked regardless of how many times the phone is flashed with new roms.\n\nExtra Virgin Tech never unlocked this phone and should be sued for saying they did.  They still have not answered my emails.  Amazon should be ashamed for allowing sellers such as this to sell through them. I give the phone 5 Stars, but EVT 1 star and Amaxon gets 1 Star for letting EVT sell through them.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI bought this phone on amazon from Extra Virgin Tech (EVT for short).  The phone is great, but EVT had loaded a custom Operating System (ROM) on it called CyanogenMOD.  This ROM was a bare bones ROM with limited functionality and it had a \"KNOWN\" problem of not working with the AT&T service. I tried calling EVT only to find they have no phone number. I got an email from Amazon and and sent them an email, which they never responded to. It took me two days to figure out what the problem was.  The only way to fix the problem was to flash the phone with a Stock ROM from Samsung.  This took a long time since I had never done anything like this before.  My first two attempts resulted in the phone being stuck on the start screen (Which scared the crud out of me).  After hours of more searching I found how to fix that and now the phone works fine.\n\nI love the phone now, but be warned; DO NOT ORDER IT FROM EXTRA VIRGIN TECH!!!!!!.

Donaldson", "reviewText": "Oct 23, 2013 WAIT before you read my original review I have new data. I was unable to lock onto an LTE signal using this phone. I went to the T-Mobile store and they said that is correct, that unlocked phones usually won't work on T-Mobile's LTE network. I then contacted the vendor Extra Virgin Tech and they sent email back confirming the weakness. I'm checking now to see if I can return the phone.\n\nI have read, for those brave enough to delve into this world, that you can \"jailbreak\" the phone and correct this issue. While I am tech savvy and feel I could pull this off I'm not willing to do so because I'm simply evaluating the T-Mobile coverage and am not sure if I will continue down this path.\n\nOriginal Reivew...\nWe are in the process of converting over from Verizon where we've been using simple feature phones for a few years. T-Mobile offers cheaper plans and we are converting to smartphones. This Skyrocket purchase is part of that conversion.\n\nI received my Skyrocket from Extra Virgin Tech the next day as promised by the Amazon Prime next day service. It was packaged like new and proved to be brand new when I opened and examined the contents of the box.\n\nThis phone is labeled AT&T at the top but was supposed to be unlocked as I want to use it on T-Mobile. I took it to the local T-Mobile store for them to help me switch my service from a Nokia Lumia 521 running Windows Phone 8 (more on that later) to the Skyrocket. I had to buy a new SIM card because the Nokia has a microSIM while the Skyrocket has a regular (full sized?) SIM. Unfortunately after the store tech switched my account we discovered the phone was locked.\n\nI emailed Extra Virgin Tech for an unlock code and, after waiting for the weekend to pass, they sent me a code which worked. I'm now able to use the phone on T-Mobile and have both sent and received test calls. I have also been able to use the T-Mobile 4G service to use the internet.\n\nThis is a lot of phone for the money.\n\nWeighing 4.66 oz. it is only 1/2 oz. heavier than the iPhone 5S which only has a 4\" screen. I notice the extra weight in my pocket because I've been carrying an iPod Touch 5th gen in that pocket for about a year and it weighs only 3.04 oz. I'll get used to it. At least I will only have to carry the Skyrocket now rather than a feature phone and the iPod Touch.\n\nThe Skyrocket is beautiful with a great AMOLED display, although it is lower resolution than many newer phones. For some reason, perhaps it is AMOLED technology, the display won't turn down as low in brightness as I'd like.\n\nThe volume out of the rear speaker is loud enough but distorts at max volume. I found I could get more volume out of the phone by going into the equalizer and turning up all frequency bands.\n\nThe camera works great although there is quite a shutter button lag. I swear it must be about 1 second from button push to capture. The LED flash is very bright. I haven't done a full evaluation on the camera quality yet.\n\nButtons:\nThe power button is located on the upper right side and the volume rocker is located across from the power button on the left side. I find this not to be ideal. When I want to use either button it is too easy to push the button on the opposite side. If I'm holding the phone in my left hand and trying to change the volume it is too easy to turn the Skyrocket off for example.\n\nI do like the four touch sensitive buttons below the screen. Some like a physical button but I like the touch sensitive button as I think it will be more reliable over time. I've had, as others have had, problems with the start button on my iPod Touch devices.\n\nThe phone has a user replaceable battery, the only way I'll buy a smartphone. This proves to be important because one of the biggest weaknesses of the phone is it tends to burn through the battery quick enough that I think it may be challenging to get through a whole day. I am a heavy user but don't make too many phone calls. It's mostly internet usage over the WiFi at home. Just today I left home with the phone 100% charged and one hour later, with no usage, the battery had dropped to 88% - and I had the WiFi turned off at the time.\n\nAs I said we have been using feature phones and iPod Touch iOS devices for a few years. So we have quite a bit of experience with iOS. There are things I like about Apples operating system but the lack of user customization really irked me. I would recommend an iPod Touch, iPad, or iPhone to someone who isn't too tech savvy, like my sister. Someone who is more tech savvy though could be frustrated as I was with iOS. iOS 7 was a huge disappointment to me with the new \"flat\" design. It was time to move away from Apple.\n\nI found T-Mobile has some very interesting plans. For the exact same Verizon $90/month we've been spending for three feature phones with no data, we can now have phone/text/internet service for three smartphones. T-Mobile's cell coverage has been weak but that has changed in 2013. It still doesn't have the coverage of Verizon or AT&T but it may just work for us.\n\nI first purchased the Nokia Lumia 521 from WalMart for $99 to try out the T-Mobile service. It has Windows Phone 8 which I liked, and I liked the phone too. It took only a few minutes to figure out the Windows Phone 8 user interface. I figured out 100% of the phone in about two hours. Unfortunately Windows Phone 8 isn't ready for prime time. Give me a break the brightness can only be set to LOW-MEDIUM-HIGH with no slider. Also there is a single volume control for all functions (radio/mp3/alarms/ringer/etc.) But the killer was there were two or three critical apps that are not available on Windows Phone 8 so I had to make the jump to Android.\n\nAndroid WOW!\nI'm blown away by the user customization of the Skyrocket/Android. I've spent many hours with it and I think I've discovered only about 70% of what it can do.\n\nA big issue for me is how easy it is to control the screen brightness. First keeping it low saves battery power but of course I have to make it brighter when using it outside and I like to turn it all the way down when I use it in bed at night. I found an option Settings->Status Bar->Brightness Control that lets you change the brightness by sliding your finger across the Status Bar. For me this is great.\n\nI spent quite a bit of time duplicating the way icons and folders were set up on my iPod Touch. This may or may not be ideal but it is the easiest way for me to transition from iOS to Android. I was mostly able to pull this duplication off. The difference is the apps, from the same organization, don't work the same way on iOS and Android. For example the USA Today news app is quite different on the two platforms while it could be identical. I think the iOS version is better. I don't understand why there would be differences.\n\nAs I've only had the Skyrocket for 4 days now I will have more to add after I've had it for a while and will report back here.", "summary": "Very nice phone with a few complaints", "unixReviewTime": 1382313600}

Before getting into details about a few of the amazing features of this excellent phone, here is a summary of what I really liked about the Blackberry Curve and how the new Samsung compares:\n\n1. It was easy to type text on the Blackberry because it has a physical keyboard which even a user with big fingers can cope with. I was put off on-screen keyboards a couple of years ago by the truly appalling and virtually un-usable Blackberry Storm, but the Samsung is really OK in this department even though its keyboard appears on-screen because the key points are so large, and when you finger a key a larger image of it pops up to confirm which key you have activated.\n\n2. The Blackberry's party piece was very easy and intuitive email management, which I need to use all day long for business messages. Well, the Samsung is surprisingly good here too, with the added bonus of a huge screen and the facility to enlarge or reduce text size with a sweep of the fingers, iPhone style. The text clarity is first class.\n\n3. The Blackberry has very long battery life and typically I'd only need to charge it every 4 or 5 days, even with heavy usage. The Samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an iPod-like music player is important to you, then this Samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).\n\n4. The Blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the Samsung is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screen\n\nHere's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my non-techie perspective:\n\n* The AMOLED screen on the Skyrocket is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iPhone or iPod. Designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length\n\n* Despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iPhone for example is around 20g heavier)\n\n* All functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the iPod4 with a similar feel\n\n* Calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is OK. The ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls\n\n* The quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)\n\n* The Samsung has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-USB port located on the base-edge of the phone. Finally manufacturers have chosen (not before time) to stop ripping-off their customers by making them buy new chargers with every new handset and begun to standardize - FINALLY!\n\nIn summary I'd say if you're looking for a smartphone, the Samsung is a very serious contender. It's beautifully designed, its screen is absolutely amazing - you need to just use it for a couple of minutes to appreciate how good it is - yet it's lightweight. The menus are intuitive and easy to master; it has loads of optional software and aps (mostly free to the user, unlike with Apple); making calls and managing email is a breeze. It's a weather forecaster, a GPS street-finder and a web browser with astoundingly clear screen definition unlike anything I ever used before.\n\nPossible cautions include barely acceptable battery life, and for this it drops a star: if you're a current Blackberry user you'll really notice this, and especially so if you use it as a music player. Also the Skyrocket might be intimidating if you're a technophobe who just wants a simple phone to make calls. But it compares very well in all essentials against the iPhone: it's lighter, cheaper and the screen is better, and most of the aps for which Apple charges you, you get with the Samsung for free.\n\nOne final point: make sure you buy a good robust case and a screen protector for it; there's plenty of choice and most of them do the job OK.", "summary": "Galaxy S2 Skyrocket: leader of the pack?", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400}

HTC has really done an amazing job with the Amaze 4G, but it is already out-shined, out-classed and out-done by the recently announced HTC One series devices.\n\nThat said, the Amaze features plenty of internal storage, a great camera, a beautiful display and is everything one could want in an Android powered smartphone. The exterior design is gorgeous and it operates on the fastest 3+G network in the country with T-Mobile. Unfortunately, the unlocking really doesn't do much good to those in the US as T-Mobile's 3G/4G network uses specific frequencies that AT&T and other rivals cannot use. The only real carrier option besides T-Mo is SIMPLE Mobile and their $60 a month prepaid option. This is the sort of device that shines on the AWS frequencies though, so it's definitely worth a solid look if you need to replace an Android device out of contract on T-Mobile.\n\nIn 2-4 months, the Amaze will be a freebie device on contract and quite a steal. The non-contract/unlocked version will still set you back $300-400 and be worth every penny. For now, T-Mobile offers a great prepaid device for $200 in the Samsung Exhibit II 4g [...] that will easily power you through the next year and doesn't set you back 4 or 5 Ben Franklins.", "summary": "Great Device - Hefty Price Tag", "unixReviewTime": 1331164800}

Spalding", "reviewText": "I have to amend my review of the Amaze after owning it for 11 months. HTC's update to Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) has broken WiFi so that it fails to connect to corporate access points. They have had increasing complaints about Bluetooth connectivity with in-car systems. I've found that HTC's proprietary software makes \"Android beaming\" with a straight Android tablet largely futile.\n\nThe worst problem: my Amaze locks up and reboots, or shuts itself off without reason, several times a month. This is unacceptable in a mobile device, particularly one based on the Linux kernel.\n\nYes, it exhibits these problems even after a factory reset and not updating any applications.\n\nT-Mobile and HTC have made excuses for several months, and left customers with phones that only partly deliver on the marketing. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone, proprietary HDMI adapter that I can't use with another phone, and several charge cables which are likewise specific to this phone.\n\nI will never buy another HTC device again. Never.\n\n** UPDATE **\nI eventually discovered one reason for the power problems: simply rubbing the screen (with the phone in \"sleep\") against cloth would cause the phone to turn off. A week or two after discovering this, I bought a Nexus 4 and put this in storage with the battery removed. When HTC/T-Mobile release an update I tried powering it back up ... the battery wouldn't charge at all, the phone wouldn't start. At all. T-Mobile sent a replacement (manufactured circa April, 2012), and this phone charged up the battery and started fine. With the fully charged battery back in the bad handset (the third one I'd received from T-Mobile, by the way), it would power up, but wouldn't charge at all (yes, with HTC chargers and cables, not third party accessories). I sent it back in disgust.\n\nThe current replacement functions well enough. I've unlocked and rooted it and now use it as a backup. Battery life is still disappointing with a moderate quantity of apps running. But since this phone will connect to my HDTV, I can use it for gaming (my daughter loves it), Hangouts, music, video, reading.\n\nThe 2013 One is by accounts a fantastic phone, and a few colleagues have bought it. Seems HTC finally figured out how to make a good phone again. But I'm pretty embittered by my experience with the Amaze ... and the Google Nexus 4 is a phenomenal phone in every way.", "summary": "Increasing problems, no resolution from HTC, this phone IS A DUD", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800}

The back panel is ok (looks like aluminum, of course the logo is painted). Camera shield is a piece of plastic with an aluminum plate barely glued to it. Plastic top and bottom r good for replacement (temporary if u don't want ur phone look ugly, though its not that visible if u don't know about it).

Smith", "reviewText": "Update: The cracks that form along the top corners are caused by a design flaw. I have purchased a second case for this issue, assuming it was caused by removing the case to install a screen protector, but the second one formed small cracks that are rapidly growing in the same area. This began after only 3 months. Supcase specifically states that cosmetic damage, such as cracks, are not covered by their warranty. Such cracks are severely detrimental and can cause damage to your screen. I do not recommend purchasing one.\n\nThe case has a solid feel and holds the phone securely. While it is not intended to use with a \"full screen\" glass protector, the case will still snap over thinner protectors and the enclosure will provide enough room to fully seal. Wireless charging is still fully-functional and does not have the same \"dead zones\" as are common with OtterBox cases. This case is slim, but does not feel flimsy. The buttons are crisp and responsive without causing an accidental press by holding the case or having it in a pocket. Having originally purchased an OtterBox that felt like a rubber condom over a cheap plastic snap-on case, this was a huge improvement at almost half the cost. The best part was removing the case to clean the dust buildup (common of my OtterBox) only to find there was almost nothing to be cleaned.\n\nAfter a few months, the left corner around the screen formed a significant crack, along with another small crack on the left and two small cracks on the right. As I had spent some time settling on a screen protector, I attributed this to removing and replacing the case with excess bulk to the screen area. I purchased a second case to replace it that was only installed once. The cracks returned.\n\nPlease be aware that the listing for green and grey is an accurate text description, but the image looks more like a black rubber portion. It is not black. Take a look at the white case to gain a better understanding of the color that should be expected. Having purchased a blue and black case, there is a significant difference in the actual color while the color in the images is nearly identical.\n\nNote: This review is provided after months of use in both residential and commercial environments.

The full body case is incredible, the other designs where its usually two pieces, rubber and plastic, that snap together and go on the back of the phone, don't offer much. The sides usually slip and the case can easily be taken off. This one locks your phone securely with the front face and back. Its not hard to put together, you put the back in first and then set in the front and work around the edges. And to take it off, theres a slit on the bottom right side where you peel it back, just work around the corners and itll come off. And one last thing, the covers that are for your charging port and headphone jack are fantastic. I know this phone is alreadydust resistant, but this will make sure zero dust or debris gets in there, so its good not to worry about that.\n\nTl:dr if you want a serious case that'll actually protect your phone and not feel like you're holding a brick, and look great while doing that, look no more.

It won't be going into a small evening style clutch, but it does fit snugly in the center pocket of my oversized clutch wallets. if you carry large bag/purse you will be able to get a hold of this case fast, without needing to look into the bag to spot it first.\n\nI have arthritis in my hands and sometimes just hanging onto the case my phone is a challenge, this one is chunky enough that gripping it on the days my fingers don't want to close makes the chunky part a huge asset!  The rubberized sides make it even easier to hang on to.\n\nThe holster is solid, the clip is pretty firm, it takes a firm push to get it to let go of the phone, no worries about bumping the clip and accidently knocking the phone out of the holster.\n\nThe back clip is also pretty hefty, stays in place on my jeans or clipped to the side of my purse.\n\nSame quality as an otterbox.....half the price!", "summary": "Doesn't come with screen protector!", "unixReviewTime": 1486425600}
